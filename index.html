        <p class="lead mb-4">Have you ever heard of Human Resources Management in the Business Administration branch? Human resources is part of the department of hiring, managing, administration, and training. You are basically responsible for running the company. It can be very work loaded but very manageable. Some skills that require you to be able to run this department are ethical skills, Communication skills, Decision Making, and active listening skills. Ethics are moral principles in someone's behavior. There is such a thing as unethical behavior and ethical behavior. An example would be when I was working with my mom in her office and an employee tried taking extra supplies to take home. I then reported them to my mom who was the manager at the time, and they got fired. I was honest about what I saw and proceeded to save supplies and our company at the same time.<br><br>

        In my experience of working with my mom as part of the human resource department, I observed the way she worked. She would bring in people often to interview and make sure they were a good candidate for the company. I would also be by her side to observe the interviewee. My mom would ask me afterwards what positive characteristics the interviewee had to learn to choose wisely in a client. The interviewee had amazing communication skills, integrity, and confidence. My mom agreed with my observation and decided to hire him for other reasons as well. Another example would be when she called out for a company meeting. Everyone gathered together to listen to what my mom had to say. There was a financial issue going on and requested help and ideas. It was nice seeing everyone collaborating and discussing their own opinion to try to make the company better. Working in her company for a couple months made me realize what I really wanted to be as I grew older. These experiences influenced my decision to become a Business Administration major at UCR.
<br><br>

        As a current Pre-business major Iâ€™ve learned communication is key for you to succeed. This allows various opportunities for yourself and your company. Without communication skills you lack connections, networking, and collaborating with others. Many minds are better than just yourself. Another thing Iâ€™ve learned from my business class is that you must organize, strategize, and make a plan for your company. If you want your business to succeed, you canâ€™t just throw out random ideas out of nowhere and proceed with only the ideas youâ€™ve come up with. You should at least have multiple ideas and come together as a whole with structure. After you have your temporary plan, you should think about your vision. Think about how well it can be conducted for the future. For example, Thinking of how much money is needed for a business, how many employees are needed, hiring managers and financiers, or how many people are actually interested in your business. All these are key factors in how your business or in any major can make you successful.
